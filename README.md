# Matrix Rain CRT Effect

## What is this?

This program displays a fullscreen visual effect simulating the "digital rain" code seen in *The Matrix* films. It includes additional effects to mimic the look of an old CRT monitor, such as scan lines, a vignette (darkened edges), and a warmer color palette.

## How to Run

1.  **Unzip (If Necessary):** If you received this program in a `.zip` file, first extract all the contents to a folder on your computer.
2.  **Run:** Locate the executable file (named `MatrixCRT.exe`) inside the folder and double-click it.
3.  The program should launch and run in fullscreen.

## How to Exit

* To close the program, simply press the **`ESC`** key on your keyboard.

## Notes

* **Antivirus:** Sometimes, executables created from Python scripts using tools like PyInstaller can trigger warnings from antivirus software (false positives). This program is safe and only displays graphics and detects the ESC key press.
* **Performance:** Requires a reasonably modern computer to run smoothly at high resolutions and frame rates.
* **Created using:** Python and Pygame.

Enjoy!
